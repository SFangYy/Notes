为什么会有这个报错Load Failed:
Warning-[UCAPI-SNF] Shape Not Found
'Fsm' coverage shape is not there in the vdb
'module/ALU/sim/coverage/cov.vdb'. Coverage of this metric will not be
reported.
Please check if proper -cm option was used at compile time.

✦ The error occurs because you have enabled FSM (Finite State Machine) coverage in your simulation script, but your design (ALU.v) is purely combinational and does not contain any State Machines.

Detailed Explanation:

1.  The Cause: Your brun_vcs.sh script includes the flag -cm line+cond+tgl+fsm+assert+branch. The +fsm part tells the VCS compiler to instrument the code for FSM coverage.
2.  The Design: I analyzed module/ALU/rtl/ALU.v and found it only contains combinational logic (assign statements, always @(\*), etc.). There are no sequential state registers (e.g., always @(posedge clk)) or
    state transition logic that VCS recognizes as an FSM.
3.  The Result: Since no FSMs were found during compilation, no FSM data was written to the coverage database (cov.vdb). When the tool tries to generate a report or check FSM coverage, it warns that the "Shape"
    (the FSM structure) is not found.

How to Fix:
You can safely ignore this warning, or you can remove fsm from the -cm options in your simulation script to make it go away.

Would you like me to remove fsm from the coverage options in module/ALU/sim/brun_vcs.sh for you?
